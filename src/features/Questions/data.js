    title: 'How often should I get my dog groomed?',
    info: `The frequency of grooming for a dog depends on several factors, including their breed, coat type, and lifestyle. As a general guideline:

      Short-haired breeds typically require grooming every 4-8 weeks.
      
      Long-haired breeds may need grooming every 4-6 weeks to prevent matting and tangles.
      
      Dogs with curly or wiry coats may need grooming every 4-6 weeks to maintain their shape.
      
      Dogs with thick undercoats may need grooming every 6-8 weeks to remove any loose hair and prevent matting.
      
      In addition to these guidelines, the frequency of grooming may also be influenced by the dog's skin and coat condition, as well as any specific health or hygiene requirements. It is best to consult with a professional groomer or veterinarian to determine the ideal grooming schedule for your dog.`,

    title: 'How often do nails need trimming?',
    info: `The frequency of nail trimming for a dog depends on their activity level and the hardness of their nails. On average, most dogs' nails should be trimmed every 4-6 weeks. However, some dogs may need more frequent trimming if their nails grow quickly, while others may only need trimming every 8-12 weeks if their nails grow slowly.

      A good indicator that your dog's nails need to be trimmed is if you can hear them clicking on hard floors. If you're unsure whether your dog's nails need to be trimmed, you can consult with a veterinarian or a professional groomer. They can help you determine the best schedule for your dog based on their specific needs.`,

    title: 'How long does it usually take?',
    info: `The duration of a dog grooming session can vary greatly depending on several factors, including the size of the dog, the thickness of their coat, and the services being performed.

      A basic bath and trim session for a small dog can take as little as 30 minutes to an hour. However, for larger dogs or those with more complex grooming needs, a grooming session can take up to 2-3 hours.
      
      It's important to note that dog grooming is not just about making a dog look good, but it's also about their health and comfort. Groomers will take their time to make sure the dog is relaxed and comfortable throughout the session.
      
      If you're unsure how long a grooming session might take for your dog, it's best to discuss your dog's specific needs with a professional groomer. They can give you a better estimate of the time required for your dog's grooming session.`,
